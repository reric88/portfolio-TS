        All text info and sprites are pulled from the contents of pokeAPI which then populates each card individually. The keys in the specified objects within the API are also used to assign the SFX, backgrounds and icons locally.
      A real-time search function is also available with multiple search methods, and does not require the page to reload. Additional features are currently being developed, such as card expansion and comparison.`,
